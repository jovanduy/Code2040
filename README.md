# Code2040
Repo for Code2040 tech assessment by Jordan Van Duyne.

## To run
In terminal, run the run script by typing:
```
sh run.sh
```
or run the python script directly:
```
python tech_assessment.py
```

## Challenges
The worst challenge I came across was figuring out exactly how the CODE2040 server expected the responses. For example, I had to do one or two trial-and-error tests to make sure I was formatting the date exactly as was expected (the 'Z' was necessary).

However, I felt that this test did not look for any algorithmic, problem solving skills. Rather, it tested to see if I knew how to write a script to complete unchanging tasks.
